<!--Div is used to have sperate divisions inside page
 This also be done using table tag

If we have p<> in css and we have 5 p tags in our HTML file and we want only one to follow the sytling...then we add id to the one which we wanted 
to be identified by CSS like

<p id="paragrah 1"> content  </p>

in CSS it is implemented as 
p{
    features
}
#paragraph1
{
    additional feature
}
.
.
.
paragraphn
{
 additional features
}

just like Test case
