<!--Instead of ids we can also uses classes in HTML
classes are used when there are a group of tags that wish to have same propeties

Each element can have only one ID
Each page can have only one element with that ID

we can also have same id for various tags but..it will be difficult
for the programmer to identify later
In CSS class is implemented as 
p 
{
    styling statements

}
.<class_name>
    {

    }
Now the question?
Can two different tags have same class??
